# CV-Lluis-Salvat-Niell
This is LaTex template I designed for creating my CV. Its main feature is the use of the \hyperref package, which allows to create hyperlinks, which in turned proved to be useful when creating the contact information section (as the email adress, phone number and LinkedIn and GitHub profile can be accessed directly by recruiters) and to provide access to one of the academic papers relevant to my research. Feel free to use it to create your own resume, performing the appropriate modifications. Last update: 26th of June 2022.
